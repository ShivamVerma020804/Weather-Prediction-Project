PROJECT OVERVIEW:

In this project, we'll predict tomorrow's temperature using historical data. We'll start by downloading a dataset of local weather. You can customize this to your own location. 
Then, we'll clean the data and get it ready for machine learning. We'll build a system to make historical predictions. 
Then, we'll add more predictors to improve the model. We'll end with how to make next-day predictions.

PROJECT STEPS:

1} Download weather data

2} Clean and graph data

3} Create a testing framework

4} Improve model accuracy
